# Spatial Structure and Tactical Style in the UEFA Women’s Euro 2025

This project analyzes team spacing, compactness, and space control in the UEFA Women’s Euro 2025 using event-level StatsBomb data. Instead of relying on traditional box-score stats (passes, shots, goals), this analysis focuses on how teams organize themselves spatially across different phases of play.

The goal is to understand how teams play — not just how often they score or win.

---

## Key Questions

- How does team compactness change between defending and attacking phases?
- Do teams differ meaningfully in how they expand or contract their shape?
- What tactical information is captured by spatial structure that box-score metrics miss?

---

## Key Findings

- Teams consistently adopt tighter spatial structures when defending and expand modestly
  when in possession.
- Differences in compactness are driven more by phase of play than by fixed team identity.
- Teams vary in how aggressively they expand in possession, reflecting stylistic and tactical
  choices rather than a single dominant approach.
- Compactness and space control describe **how teams play** more reliably than **how often
  they win**, showing weak direct relationships with match outcomes.

## Why This Matters

Spatial metrics provide structural context that complements traditional performance statistics.
Analyses like this can support tactical profiling, opponent scouting, and style-based team
comparison by quantifying how teams organize themselves beyond on-ball events.
